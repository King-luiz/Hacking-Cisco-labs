00:07.769 --> 00:12.699
Passwords are one of the weakest links in the
security chain for a variety of reasons.

00:12.710 --> 00:18.959
But primarily because of human behavior, people
choose weak passwords and use the same password

00:18.969 --> 00:23.280
across multiple accounts.
These passwords are often easy to brute force

00:23.290 --> 00:27.010
with a variety of tools.
And because passwords are typically stored in

00:27.020 --> 00:33.110
encrypted hashes tools have evolved that can
crack these hashes revealing the passwords.

00:33.119 --> 00:36.139
In this lab.
You will use three popular tools to crack

00:36.150 --> 00:41.099
passwords, hash cat, John, the Ripper and
Rainbow crack.

00:41.610 --> 00:46.700
It is important to note that while these are
legitimate security tools always make sure you

00:46.709 --> 00:50.849
have proper written authorization before
attempting to crack passwords for a client

00:50.860 --> 00:54.740
engagement.
Part one is to investigate the password tools

00:54.750 --> 01:01.069
you have on your call.
EVM log in to your Cali BM from the

01:01.080 --> 01:03.790
applications menu select password attacks.

01:04.370 --> 01:07.709
There are a ton of tools available in four
categories.

01:14.290 --> 01:17.269
Part two is to use hash cat to crack passwords.

01:17.949 --> 01:23.220
Hash cat is a popular password cracking tool
used by security professionals to recover lost

01:23.230 --> 01:29.709
passwords, conduct security assessments and
test the strength of passwords in an actual

01:29.720 --> 01:33.180
exploit threat actors first compromise a
vulnerable system.

01:33.550 --> 01:38.819
They then look for and copy a password file
containing stored password hashes that can be

01:38.830 --> 01:39.940
cracked offline.

01:40.360 --> 01:46.190
Step one is to simulate this by creating a
password file that contains MD five hashes.

01:46.199 --> 01:53.080
You will crack, copy the echo scripts from your
lab, open a terminal and paste in the script.

01:53.830 --> 01:56.500
Use cat to verify the hashes you created.

01:57.029 --> 02:02.260
Step two is to investigate the man pages for
hash catt inner man hash cat.

02:03.008 --> 02:09.580
Take note of the two options.
M and A M defines the hash type and A

02:09.589 --> 02:11.210
defines the attack mode.

02:12.089 --> 02:17.300
Tap the space bar, scrolling through the rest
of the man pages until you find the attack mode

02:17.309 --> 02:19.440
and hash type configuration options.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.559
You will use a straight or dictionary tack.

02:23.779 --> 02:29.220
And the MD five.
Hashtag step three is to view Callie's

02:29.229 --> 02:36.080
available word lists that can be used to crack
hashes inner ls hyphen LH and then the path to

02:36.089 --> 02:37.419
the word list directory.

02:38.350 --> 02:42.839
Note that the size of the rock UG zip file is
51 megabytes.

02:43.229 --> 02:49.339
It contains over 14 million passwords, change
your directory to the wordless directory,

02:50.509 --> 02:57.380
unzip the compressed rock U file list the
directory contents to verify the rock U dot

02:57.389 --> 02:59.050
TXT file is unzipped.

03:00.029 --> 03:06.210
Use more to display raq notice how many easy
passwords are in the file

03:07.380 --> 03:10.330
in our queue to quit the list and return to the
home directory.

03:10.539 --> 03:16.889
Step four is to use hash catt to crack the
passwords in the file of password hashes using

03:16.899 --> 03:21.130
pseudo enter the hashtag command setting the
options M and A to zero.

03:21.940 --> 03:28.380
The O option defines the output file, enter
cracks dot TXT as the output file and the file

03:28.389 --> 03:30.000
with the hashes as the input.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.419
Finally specify the rock you file as the word
list.

03:33.429 --> 03:40.179
Hash catt should use press enter and hash catt
starts depending on your computer.

03:40.190 --> 03:44.699
It should only take a few seconds to crack the
passwords as none of them were complex.

03:46.139 --> 03:52.089
View the contents of the output file to see the
hashes and the cracked passwords note that you

03:52.100 --> 03:54.190
must use root privileges to view it.

03:54.500 --> 03:59.729
Part three is to use John, the ripper to crack
your password file using the rock you word list.

04:00.490 --> 04:07.309
Step one is to view the help file for John pipe.
John hyphen H to more if you want to

04:07.320 --> 04:12.820
view the help contents one screen at a time,
step two is to use John to crack the password

04:12.830 --> 04:19.529
file, copy the command from the lab or enter
the John command manually specifying raw MD

04:19.540 --> 04:22.720
five as the format and your password hash file.

04:24.190 --> 04:26.799
Notice that three passwords are cracked
immediately.

04:27.660 --> 04:32.029
If you let it run long enough, it will
eventually crack the rest of the passwords

04:32.299 --> 04:34.149
because they are not too complex.

04:35.059 --> 04:37.149
But let's enter queue to abort the session.

04:38.679 --> 04:42.890
Step three is to use a word list with John to
crack the password file,

04:43.970 --> 04:49.709
copy the command from the lab or manually enter
the John command using the word list option to

04:49.720 --> 04:56.089
specify the directory where you decompressed
rock, U finish the command as previously

04:56.100 --> 05:00.279
specifying the MD five format and the file with
your password hashes,

05:01.670 --> 05:05.380
skipping step four.
What you can do on your own step five is to

05:05.390 --> 05:07.470
show the passwords you just cracked.

05:08.750 --> 05:14.359
Enter John with the show option and then
specify the MD five format and the file with

05:14.369 --> 05:19.239
your password.
Hashes do step six on your own time.

05:19.609 --> 05:25.000
Try some more complex passwords of varying
links from 4 to 8 characters and see how long

05:25.010 --> 05:29.619
they take to crack.
Part four is to use rainbow crack and rainbow

05:29.630 --> 05:31.399
tables to crack some hashes.

05:32.059 --> 05:38.049
Step one is to install rainbow crack, enter the
pseudo app to install rainbow crack command.

05:38.429 --> 05:42.859
Step two is to generate some rainbow tables
with the RT G command.

05:42.989 --> 05:46.470
Rainbow tables can be generated or downloaded
from the internet.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.149
They can be very large from 20 gigabytes to
more than a terabyte for this lab.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.290
You will create a small rainbow table that you
can use to crack.

05:54.299 --> 05:59.450
Very simple passwords display the help pages
for RT G here.

05:59.459 --> 06:04.320
You can see all the options and algorithms you
can use to generate rainbow tables.

06:04.329 --> 06:07.869
Notice at the bottom there are some examples of
how to use the command.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.790
Let's create a table using the following
options.

06:11.399 --> 06:17.410
MD five lower case letters with a minimum of
one character and a maximum of three characters.

06:17.420 --> 06:23.529
Zero for the reduction function 1000 for chain
length or the number of hash computations

06:23.540 --> 06:29.190
performed 1000 for the number of chains and
zero for the chain offset.

06:29.859 --> 06:35.100
Further explanation of some of these options is
beyond the scope of this lab to verify the

06:35.109 --> 06:36.250
table was created.

06:36.459 --> 06:42.070
Navigate to the user share rainbow crack
directory and list the contents the file with

06:42.079 --> 06:44.809
the dot RT extension is your rainbow table.

06:45.230 --> 06:49.760
Step three is to crack some lower case
passwords that are three characters long.

06:49.769 --> 06:54.070
First to improve the efficiency and speed of
your new rainbow table.

06:54.309 --> 06:56.209
Enter the RT sort command.

06:56.459 --> 07:00.209
You can use a period to specify all the files
in your current directory.

07:00.309 --> 07:03.209
As your dot RT file is the only rainbow table.

07:03.619 --> 07:09.829
Let's crack a three letter password copy and
paste the echo command from the lab to generate

07:09.839 --> 07:16.279
an MD five hash for the password dog, copy the
generated hash and use R crack with a

07:16.290 --> 07:19.940
period again because your rainbow table is in
the current directory.

07:19.950 --> 07:26.140
And option H to specify you are cracking a
single hash paste in your copied hash

07:26.690 --> 07:30.019
press enter your hash is cracked within
milliseconds.

07:30.809 --> 07:36.940
Now let's crack a password file, copy the echo
commands from your lab and paste them into the

07:36.950 --> 07:38.339
Cali VM command line.

07:39.119 --> 07:43.940
This time use the option L to tell R crack to
use the hash file you created.

07:43.950 --> 07:46.640
Press enter again in less than a second.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.750
All three passwords are cracked.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.489
Step four is to search the internet for rainbow
tables.

07:52.829 --> 07:56.630
Enter rainbow table.
Download and look through the search results.

07:56.739 --> 07:59.630
Project.
Rainbow Crack is an excellent source for

07:59.640 --> 08:00.700
rainbow tables.

08:01.470 --> 08:06.549
Hopefully, if you didn't already know now, you
understand why it is so important that we use

08:06.559 --> 08:08.000
complex passwords.

08:08.269 --> 08:14.359
The more complex a password, the more difficult
it is to crack as a pin tester.

08:14.369 --> 08:19.279
You can use tools like hash catt John and
Rainbow crack to demonstrate password

08:19.290 --> 08:25.450
vulnerability to your clients have fun as you
further explore password tools and their uses.
